# ⚠️ EXECUTION NOTICE

This repository is a **CODE SHOWCASE ONLY** and **cannot be executed**.

## Why Docker Compose files are renamed

The `docker-compose.yml` file has been renamed to `docker-compose.yml.showcase` to:

1. **Prevent accidental execution attempts**
2. **Demonstrate technical expertise** without allowing deployment
3. **Preserve architectural documentation** for portfolio review

## What you can do with this repository

✅ **Review the code** to understand the architecture
✅ **Examine the configuration** to see the microservices design
✅ **Read the documentation** to learn about the technical choices
✅ **View the live demo** at http://84.235.229.76:3000/

## What you CANNOT do

❌ Execute `docker compose up` (file renamed to prevent this)
❌ Run the application locally (all secrets removed)
❌ Deploy to production (intentionally neutralized)

## For recruiters and technical reviewers

This repository demonstrates:
- **Microservices architecture** with 14 containerized services
- **Event-driven design** using Apache Kafka
- **Data engineering** with pandas, DuckDB, and Apache Spark
- **DevOps practices** with Docker orchestration
- **Production-ready infrastructure** with monitoring and observability

The `.showcase` files are renamed Docker Compose configurations that show the complete system architecture without allowing execution.
